# Radix Sort Analyses in Parallel and Serial Way

### _ABSTRACT_
_This paper presents a comparative analysis of parallel and serial version of radix sort algorithm: Sorting time and speed variation CPU and GPU execution of these algorithms. For that purpose, we have implemented parallel radix sort that using threads for parallelism in GPU and radix sort that is being executed in CPU as serial execution. Both process implemented in order to run on GTX860M architecture._
